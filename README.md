Privacy policy for the "Grocery-list" App.
Effective date: [09/05/2025]

Sallden Studios (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) built the Grocery List app as a free productivity tool. This service is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and is intended for personal use.

- Information Collection and Use

The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us or to third parties.

All grocery list items you enter are stored locally on your device only.

The app does not require an account, login, or internet connection for core functionality.

- Advertising

At launch, the app contains no active third-party ads.

A placeholder banner space exists for possible future advertising integration. If ads are introduced, this policy will be updated and you will be notified via an app update.

- Permissions

The app only uses permissions required for saving your list data locally.

The app does not request or access your contacts, location, camera, microphone, or other personal information.

- Children‚Äôs Privacy

The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since no personal data is collected, it is safe for use by general audiences.

- Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, we will post the new version here and update the effective date.
